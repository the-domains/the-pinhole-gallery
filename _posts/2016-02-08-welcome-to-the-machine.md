A New Day

In the beginning there was html and there were cameras. At one point there were no images in html and still, people were fascinated. This carried on for some time until the standards caught up and images and the 'img' tag became part of the lingua franca of the web. 

Jump ahead over 20 years. Pinhole photography is more popular than ever. There is a generation of new photographers discovering analog imaging for the first time with wide-eyed fascination and the way we build web sites has evolved to the point where artificial (tasked based) intelligences are doing the design work. 

And now we get to see it all together on one place. Low tech meets latest wave of tech and how it all works together. Welcome to the newest iteration of the Pinhole Gallery. I hope this works. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b4cde03f-389f-467c-b672-e12e2507dd6b.jpg)
